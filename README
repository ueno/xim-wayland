xim-wayland
===========

xim-wayland is a protocol translator between XIM and the wl_text_input
protocol.  It runs as an XIM server that intercepts XIM requests and
converts them into appropriate wl_text_input requests (and back).

The code is mostly self-contained, including an XCB binding of XIM
server protocol (not using worn IMdkit), and doesn't require any extra
library except libwayland-client and libxcb.

Usage
=====

Under weston session with XWayland enabled, do:

$ ./xim-wayland --locale=en &
$ LANG=en_US.utf8 XMODIFIERS=@im=wayland xterm
